Chapter 3: Spells
                HIS CHAPTER OFFERS NEW SPELLS FOR
                many of the classes in the Player’s Handbook.
                These spells provide various ways to harness the
                traditionally “evil” magics: necromancy, blood
                magic, and shadow magic.
                   Your DM determines whether these spells are
                available at character creation, or whether they
                are discovered in an ancient tomb or library or
                other storehouse of magical knowledge.
  Also, this chapter includes rules for a new tag: hemomancy.

Hemomancy
Certain spells included in this supplement have the special tag:
hemomancy. Such a spell has an additional cost when it is cast:
your own hit points. When you cast a spell with this tag, you must
spend a number of hit points during the casting of the spell.
Spending hit points in this way causes you to take necrotic
damage equal to the amount spent, which cannot be reduced
through any means. The number of hit points you can spend is
based on the spell’s level, and is shown in the table below. You
may not use temporary hit points to cast hemomancy spells.

Hemomancy Spell Table
Spell Level        Minimum Cost           Maximum Cost
   1st                  1                     10                      .
   2nd                   4                    15
   3rd                   7                    20                      .
   4th                  10                    25
   5th                  13                    30                    .
   6th                  16                    35
   7th                  19                    40                    .
   8th                  22                    45
   9th                  25                    50                    .

   When you cast a spell with the hemomancy tag, you must
spend a number of hit points that is between the minimum and the
maximum amount you can spend. For example, if you are casting
a spell of 2nd level, you must spend at least 4 hit points to cast it,
though you can choose to spend up to 15 hit points in order to
increase the power of the spell.

Spell Lists
The following spell lists show which of the new spells are for a

Spell Descriptions
The spells are presented in alphabetical order.
Animate Blood
3rd-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (droplets of blood)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.
You animate droplets of your own blood to act under your
command. For every three hit points spent in the casting of this
spell, you create a droplet of animated blood.
   As you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on each of your
turns thereafter, you can mentally command the droplets to move
as long as they are within 120 feet of you. The droplets have a
speed of 30 feet, and a climbing speed of 15 feet.
   As an action on your turn, you can choose to see and hear from
the location of one of the blood droplets until the end of your
turn, becoming blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.
Additionally, you may instead use your action to cause one of the
droplets to explode in a burst of necromantic energy, destroying
the droplet and damaging surrounding creatures. Each creature
within 5 feet of the droplet must make a Dexterity saving throw.
A creature takes 6d4 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
At Higher Levels.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot
level above 3rd.
end
Aura of Shade
2nd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a deep black stone)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a 15-foot radius sphere of shadow magic centered on a
point within range. The area appears to be wreathed in swirling
shadows and darkness, and is easily identifiable when it is in an
area of bright or dim light. The sphere spreads around corners,
and each creature that ends their turn within the area becomes
invisible. This invisibility ends for a creature if they attack, cast a
spell, or leave the area. Anything they are wearing or carrying is
also invisible as long as they are.
Banshee’s Wail
6th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (20-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (a strand of banshee hair)
Duration: Instantaneous
You release a mournful wail that pierces into the mind of those
that hear it. Each creature within 20 feet of you must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8
psychic damage, falls unconscious, and is deafened for 1 minute.
On a success, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other
effect. An unconscious creature wakes up after 1 hour, if it takes
any damage, or if another creature uses its action to shake them
awake. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
end
Beacon of False Life
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (alcohol or distilled spirits)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Necromantic energy emanates from you in a 30-foot radius area.
Until the spell ends, the area moves with you, centered on you.
While within the area, you and every creature that you have under
your control (such as through an animate dead spell) gains 2d4
temporary hit points at the start of each of their turns. These
temporary hit points last until they leave the area.
end
Blackblood
1st-level transmutation (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
You transform a portion of your blood into a poisonous substance.
As you cast this spell, you must spend a number of hit points.
You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount
spent. For as long as these temporary hit points last, whenever a
creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you they
take 1d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the start of
their next turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for
each slot level above 1st.
end
Blackflame
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You choose a flame that you can see within range and that fits
within a 5-foot cube. The flame momentarily changes color into a
deep black, and then lashes out at surrounding creatures. Each
creature within a 5-foot radius extending from the flame must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 necrotic
damage and 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
At Higher Levels.
 When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.
end
Bloodburn
1st-level evocation (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You inflict a burning pain upon yourself, causing another creature
that you can see within range to feel an even more excruciating
pain as their blood boils. As you cast the spell, you must spend a
number of hit points. The creature must then make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 + the
number of hit points spent as fire damage, and immediately falls
prone as they become wracked with pain. On a successful save,
the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone.
Constructs, elementals, and undead are immune to this spell.
At Higher Levels.
 When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot
level above 1st.
end

Bloodcurse
5th-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: S
Duration: Varies (see below)
You touch a creature’s open wound and bestow a curse. As you
spend a number of hit points to cast the spell, that creature must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. During the
casting of the spell, you can make a Charisma (Deception) check
against the target’s Wisdom (Insight) check to attempt to conceal
the spell’s true nature, such as pretending to bandage their wound.
   The curse has no effect until after 1 hour. Thereafter, the curse
lasts for a number of days equal to the number of hit points spent,
and for that duration the cursed creature can’t regain hit points
and is poisoned. Every 8 hours the creature is cursed, they take
3d4 necrotic damage as the curse rots away at them.
A remove curse spell ends this effect.
   At Higher Levels.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot
level above 5th.
end
Bloodletting
Necromancy cantrip (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a creature and spend 1 hit point, opening a wound
where you touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On
a hit, the target takes 1d12 necrotic damage. If this damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points
equal to half the damage dealt. These temporary hit points last for
up to 1 minute.
   The spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level
(2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).
end
Blood Seal
2nd-level necromancy (hemomancy) (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (an ornate dagger worth at least 25 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
You inflict a wound upon yourself to create a protective seal on
another creature within range. As you cast the spell, you spend a
number of hit points and the target gains 1d10 + the number of hit
points spent as temporary hit points for the duration.
  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the target gains 1d10 additional temporary hit
points for each slot level above 2nd.
Bloodsight
3rd-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You draw out a portion of your blood, causing your eyes to take
on a crimson hue. For the duration, you can see the life force of
nearby creatures. The range of this vision is a number of feet
equal to 5 times the number of hit points spent on this spell.
  When a creature is at full health, they appear perfectly normal,
but as they become more wounded a red aura begins to surround
them. You can notice when a creature’s current hit points are
below 1/2 or 1/4 of their hit point maximum. If a creature is
below 1/2 of their hit point maximum, you can see them even
through walls and invisibility.
At Higher Levels.
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
level or higher, the duration is 1 hour. If you use a slot of 7th level
or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot,
the duration is 24 hours. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher
grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.
end
Clinging Shadows
2nd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (bat fur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You choose an area of dim light or darkness that you can see
within range and that fits within a 20-foot cube. Each creature
within the area must succeed on Strength saving throw or be
restrained by shadows until the spell ends. A creature restrained
by the shadows can use its action to make a Strength check
against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
   Until the spell ends, you can use an action on each of your
turns to cause a tendril of shadow to reach out and grab a creature
within 15 feet of the area. The creature must repeat the saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is pulled into the area and
becomes restrained.
   If the area becomes bathed in bright light, the spell has no
effect until the bright light fades.
end
Cruorwhip
1st-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
You create a whip out of your own blood in your free hand. By
spending a number of hit points, you create a whip similar in size
and shape to a normal whip. If you let go of the whip, it
disappears, but you can recreate it again as a bonus action.
  You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the
whip. For every 5 hit points spent in the casting of this spell the
reach increases by 5 feet, with a minimum health cost of 5 hit
points. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 necrotic damage.
At Higher Levels.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the damage increases to 3d6. When you use a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases to 4d6.
When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage
increases to 5d6. When you use a 9th level spell slot, the damage
increases to 6d6.
end

the walls of the dome, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.
The dome is filled with dim light, and the inside of the dome
shows an accurate representation of the night sky, including the
current location of the stars and moon.
   If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created
by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is
dispelled.
end
Draining Thread
4th-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You open a wound on your body, shooting out a thread of blood
between yourself and a creature within range. As you cast the
spell, you must spend a number of hit points. The creature must
then succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 7d6 + the
number of hit points spent as necrotic damage. If this damage
brings the target to 0 hit points, half the hit point cost is refunded
as blood drains through the thread back into your body.
At Higher Levels.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot
level above 4th.
end
Drain Life
9th-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You open a deep wound on your body, draining the life of another
creature as your own blood leaves your body. As you cast the
spell, you must spend a number of hit points. The creature must
then make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 12d12
+ double the number of hit points spent as necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Dueling Shadows
end
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each
other. Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or

If one of the creatures moves before the start of your next turn,
both targets must repeat the saving throw as the shadows lash out
again, dealing another 1d4 necrotic damage
   The spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level
(2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
end
Flicker
3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (displacer beast fur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Your body begins to flicker in and out of existence as shadow
magic envelops you. For the duration of the spell, you can
use your bonus action to teleport 5 feet. Additionally,
when you are targeted by an attack you can use
your reaction to attempt to teleport out of harm's
way. Roll a d20. On a roll of 11 or higher, the
attack automatically misses, and you teleport
5 feet. Otherwise, the attack is made as
normal and you teleport 5 feet shortly after.
Hand of the Grave
2nd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (hand of a humanoid)
Duration: 24 hours
When you cast this spell, you bury a humanoid hand into a patch
of loose earth at least 5 feet in diameter to conceal it. The area is
nearly undisturbed and requires a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.
   The hand animates when a medium or smaller creature walks
over the area of earth. You can further refine the trigger so the
spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to
physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind
(for example, the spell could be set to affect aberrations or drow),
or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't
trigger the spell, such as those who say a certain password.
   When the hand animates, it attempts to grab whatever creature
triggered it. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and become restrained as
the hand grasps it with an inhumanly strong grip. The creature
can use an action on its turn to make a Strength check against
your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success. Once the hand has
animated for 1 minute, the spell ends, and the hand returns to
normal. If the creature dies while restrained, the hand pulls it
underground, burying it.
end
Hemoplague
7th-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, (a poison or venom)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You draw out a portion of your blood, infecting it with a vile
poison before causing it to streak towards creatures within range.
As you cast this spell, you must spend a number of hit points,
allowing you to target 1 creature for every 5 hit points spent. Each
creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
a target takes 6d8 necrotic damage and is also infected for the
duration. On a success, the target takes half damage and suffers
no additional effect. An infected target is poisoned, can’t regain
hit points, and whenever they take bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage, they take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage as
they bleed profusely. A creature repeats the saving throw at the
start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
At Higher Levels.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
8th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each
slot level above 7th.
end
Ichorous Smite
2nd-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You imbue a weapon with a portion of your life force, spending a
number of hit points as you cast the spell. The first time you hit
with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, the attack
deals additional necrotic damage equal to 2d4 + the number of hit
points spent.
At Higher Levels. 
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot
level above 2nd.
end
Inflict Pain
1st-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a creature, inflicting them with negative energy and
racking them with excruciating pain. The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 necrotic damage and
become incapacitated with pain until the start of your next turn.
At Higher Levels. 
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot
level above 1st.
end
Investiture of Shadow
6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, shadows swirl around you, and you gain the
following benefits:
At the start of each of your turns, you turn invisible. If you
attack or cast a spell, this invisibility ends.
You can see normally in darkness, both magical and
nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.
You can use your action to create a 15-foot radius sphere of
magical darkness centered on a point you can see within 60
feet of you, as per the darkness spell. This darkness lasts for
the duration, or until you activate this ability again.
end
Lacerate
Necromancy cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Two bolts of necrotic energy shoot from your fingertips towards a
single creature within range. Make two ranged spell attacks
against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 necrotic damage.
If both bolts hit the target, they strike simultaneously as a single
instance of damage, and the target’s hit point maximum is
reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. The

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (flake of skin or bone from an undead)
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a creature, transferring a virulent disease into their
body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, it takes 8d4 necrotic damage, or half as much damage
on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce a target’s hit points
below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, it can’t take reactions
for the next 10 minutes as the disease clouds their brain. Any
effect that removes a disease allows a creature to remove the
secondary effect.

4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot
level above 3rd.

Memento Mori
8th-level necromancy (hemomancy)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell dominates the minds and bodies of humanoids,
consuming them in a frenzy of death. As you cast the spell, you
must spend a number of hit points. Roll 14d8 and add twice the
number of hit points spent to the roll; the total is how many hit
points of creatures this spell can affect. Humanoids within 30 feet
of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order
of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
   Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points,
each creature affected by this spell is under your control until the
spell ends. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before
moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A
creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining
total for that creature to be affected. Creatures immune to being
charmed aren’t affected by this spell.
   On each of your turns, you can issue commands to the
creatures under your control, directing them where to move and
attack. If a creature doesn’t receive orders from you, they attack
the closest creature to them. If a creature hasn’t made an attack by
the end of its turn, the spell ends for them.
   If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole
duration, each creature that is still under the spell’s effect when
the spell ends dies.

the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
target takes 4d6 + half the number of hit points spent as necrotic
damage, and its movement speed is slowed by 5 feet for the
duration of the spell. On a success, the target takes half as much
damage and is not slowed. The slow can stack with itself, but it

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet

shadow forcibly ripped from their body, conjuring a Shadow
(Monster Manual pg. 269) in an unoccupied space next to them.
As long as the shadow is separate from their body, they do not
cast a shadow. A shadow created through this spell reforms with
its host when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends, and it
disappears if its host dies. If its host dies, a new shadow does not
rise from the corpse.
   The shadows seek only to attack the creature they were
separated from, and disappear when that creature is killed. Roll
initiative for the shadows as a group, which has its own turns.
They spend their turns attacking their host, without any thought
for strategy or tactics.
   The DM has the creature’s statistics.

you can use to either pull yourself to a location, or pull an object
or creature to you. As you cast the spell, you must spend a
number of hit points. Then, you immediately send the rope to
grab a target that you can see within a range equal to 5 times the
number of hit points spent. Once you grab a target, you can either
pull yourself to a location within 5 feet of the target, or you can
attempt to pull the target to a location within 5 feet of you. In
order to pull the target to you, it must weigh less than 100 pounds,
and if it is a creature it can make a Strength saving throw to avoid
being pulled. If you pull yourself to a target, you move in a
straight line towards the target and take opportunity attacks as
normal.
At Higher Levels.

3rd level or higher, the amount of weight you can pull increases
by 100 pounds for each slot level above 2nd.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius hemisphere)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You transform your blood into a 10-foot-radius protective dome
that forms around and above you and remains stationary for the
duration. The dome can be damaged, and it has a number of hit
points equal to 20 + double the amount of hit points spent in the
casting of this spell. Any creature within the dome cannot be
targeted by creatures outside the dome, and vice versa. Spells and
attacks that would pass or extend through the dome instead hit the
dome, dealing it damage, and do not extend farther. As long as the
dome lasts you can use your action to spend a number of hit
points and add this amount to the dome’s current hit points.
   Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the
dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature
or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the
dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All
other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it.
   The dome is semi-transparent. It can be seen through, but
things seen through the walls appear distorted and blurred with
the red color of the dome.

for each slot level above 4th.

points, and you may also gain the hit points needed from corpses

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything
it’s wearing and carrying, into an animated shadow for the

of movement is a walking and climbing speed of 20 feet, and it
cannot jump or otherwise remove itself from the surface it moves
on. This movement is completely noiseless, and allows the target
to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down
on ceilings. The target can enter and occupy the space of another
creature. It has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, Dexterity
(Stealth) checks, and is always hidden in darkness. The target can
pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks,
though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The
target can't fall and remains on the surface it was on even when
stunned or otherwise incapacitated.
   While in the shadowy form, the target can't talk or manipulate
objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be
dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't
attack or cast spells.
